# DrupalX Design System

This Storybook contains all the UI components for our project, built with
**Bootstrap 5** and integrated seamlessly with **Drupal 10/11**. Each component
has its own story showcasing its different states and variations. Below, you'll
find guidance on how to navigate and use this Storybook effectively.

## Getting Started

To begin, select a component from the sidebar on the left. You can then view
the different stories associated with that component, each representing a
unique state or variation. Our components leverage the power and flexibility of
Bootstrap 5, ensuring responsive and accessible designs.

## Usage

Each story is interactive and can be modified using the knobs available in the
addons panel. These knobs allow you to change the properties of the components
and see how they react in real-time.

In the toolbar, you can toggle between the **Bootstrap light and dark themes**.

Stories under the "Editorial" section are available as components for authors
in Drupal.

## Feedback

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please create

Our goal is to provide a robust set of components that make it easier to build
beautiful, responsive websites with Drupal 10/11 and Bootstrap 5.
